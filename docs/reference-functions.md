title: Functions
---

Since there are so many functions built-in, I have divided them by categories:

- [Operators](operators.html): Prefix, infix, and suffix operators dealing with any kind of data types
- [Global functions](global_functions.html): Global functions with parameters
- [Object functions](object_functions.html): Functions that are defined on specific data types
