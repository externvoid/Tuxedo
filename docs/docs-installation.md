There are a few ways to add Tuxedo to your project.

<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

---

### `Using Swift Package Manager`

Just add the following line to your dependencies in the `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/tevelee/Tuxedo.git", from: "1.0.0"),
```

And reference it by name in your targets:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyAwesomeApp", dependencies: ["Tuxedo"]),
]
```

And finally, run the integration command:

```bash
swift package resolve
```

### `Using CocoaPos`

Just add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Tuxedo', '~> 1.0.0'
```
And install the new dependency:

```bash
pod install
```

### `Using Carthage`

Just add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "tevelee/Tuxedo" >= 1.0.0
```
And install the new dependency:

```bash
carthage update
```

### `Manually`

(Not recommended! Please use a package manager instead to keep your dependencies up to date.)

Clone the repository content and copy the files into a new target in your app.
